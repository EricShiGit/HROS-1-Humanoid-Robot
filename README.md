HROS1-Framework, based on Darwin-OP framework, is a collaborative software project based on the open source Darwin-OP Framework, with the intent to continue development, implement an API to expose higher level functions of the framework, and develop additional features. 

I am working on my own fork of the project since I am adding additional sensors and components to the humanoid. 

Contributions & authoring to codebase provided by Farrell Robotics, Interbotix, DresnerRobotics, Zerom, ROBOTIS, KevinO, KurtE, mfergs.

A special thanks to Farrell Robotics, a massive contributor to humanoid robotics & continued development to the Darwin-OP framework. 

All code within project is GPL GNU v3.
